        <h3 class="headline">Welcome to the 4th edition of contour 556, Canberra's Art Biennial</h3>
            <p class="homeText">
                The 2022 edition sees the festival rebranded as Canberra Art Biennial, and sees expansion to the National Arboretum (contour 656), the University of Canberra (contour 606) as well as maintaining and building further on our presence in North and South Canberra, centred on contour 556, the height above sea level of Lake Burley Griffin.  
            </p>
            <p class="homeText">
                Canberra Art Biennial extends across Canberra's public spaces, and we are excited to partner with more  private and public gallery / cultural spaces in inner north and south Canberra.

                University of Canberra joins us as a major sponsor and supporter - The Faculty of Arts and Design students have revisited our logo and graphic branding, and we are delighted to have Julian and Ben contribute to the event.
            </p>
            <p class="homeText">
                Artists will be responding  to the designed city of Canberra: represented by Australia's political, cultural and physical history. The event engages people of all ages and abilities, delighting, puzzling and encouraging interaction with art and public space.
