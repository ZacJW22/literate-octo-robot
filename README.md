### Overview
Hello!

This is the markdown file, containing various notes and thoughts I had while developing the site, as well as challenges that I faced mid development.

I have formatted it in a way in which the numbers listed below will correlate to numbers commented in various places of interest within the code, highlighting the challenge or technique.

Happy Reading!

1. Navbar - One of the first additional features I wanted to integrate. Nearly every article-based/informative site features a navigation bar that takes readers to various other locations of the site. Having this featured at the very top makes it obvious there are other areas of the site viewers can look at and adding titles to each individual button indicates what type of info readers can expect if they click the link

2. Footer - One of the more challenging aspects of the design was to make the footer work correctly. Initially changes I was making in the CSS wasn't being reflected in the site, but thanks to a bit of extra research into why these changes weren't making any affect, I changed the technique a little around spacing and padding to create the look I was after

3. Form - One of the latest additions made to the site was the inclusion of an text box and entry button to the footer of the site. On the actual Contour 556 site, there is a text box at the bottom asking readers to subscribe to their newsletter. I have recreated that in my version of the site, except for the fact that the submit button just reloads the page. In reality, this would subscribe readers the the newsletter list, but I left that out for logistical purposes with this assignment

4. Navbar Links - The links present on the Navbar don't actually lead anywhere, but are just there for demonstrative purposes. Similar to the last note, these would link to other sub-sites within the main site, but were left out for logistical purposes
